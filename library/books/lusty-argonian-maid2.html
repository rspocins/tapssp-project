  <br />
  Lifts-Her-Tail<br />
  My goodness, that's quite a loaf! But how ever shall it fit my oven?<br />
  <br />
  Crantius Colto<br />
  This loaf isn't ready for baking, my sweet. It has yet to rise.<br />
  <br />
  Lifts-Her-Tail<br />
  If only we could hurry that along. How would I accomplish such a task?<br />
  <br />
  Crantius Colto<br />
  Oh, my foolish little Argonian maid, you must use your hands.<br />
  <br />
  Lifts-Her-Tail<br />
  You wish me to kneed the loaf? Here?<br />
  <br />
  Crantius Colto<br />
  Of course.<br />
  <br />
  Lifts-Her-Tail<br />
  But what if the mistress catches me? Your loaf was meant to satisfy her appetite.<br />
  <br />
  Crantius Colto<br />
  Don't fret, my delicate flower. I'll satisfy the mistress's cravings later.<br />
  <br />
  Lifts-Her-Tail<br />
  Very well, but I'm afraid my oven isn't hot enough. It could take hours!<br />
  <br />
  Crantius Colto<br />
  Plenty of time, my sweet. Plenty of time.<br />
