  <p class="sgc-2"><i>This book was apparently written in Dwemer and translated to Aldmeris. Only fragments of the Aldmeris is readable, but it may be enough for a scholar of Aldmeris to translate fragments of other Dwemer books.</i><br />
  <br />
  ...guide Altmer-Estrial led with foot-flames for the town-center where lay dead the quadrangular gardens...<br />
  <br />
  ...asked the foundations and chains and vessels their naming places...<br />
  <br />
  ...why they did not use solid sound to teach escape from the Earth Bones nor nourished them with frozen flames...<br />
  <br />
  ....the word I shall have once written of, this "art" our lesser cousins speak of when their admirable ignorance...<br />
  <br />
  ...but neither words nor experience cleanses the essence of the strange and terrible ways of defying our ancestors' transient rules.<br />
  <br />
  <i>The translation ends with a comment in Dwemer in a different hand, which you may be translated as follows:</i><br />
  <br />
  "Put down your ardent cutting-globes, Nbthld. Your Aldmeris has the correct words, but they cannot be properly misinterpreted."<br /></p>
