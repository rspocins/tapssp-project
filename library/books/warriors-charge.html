  <p class="sgc-1">An old poem of the Redguards</p>

  <p class="sgc-1"><br /></p>

  <p class="sgc-2">The star sung far-flung tales<br />
  Wreathed in the silver of Yokuda fair,<br />
  Of a Warrior who, arrayed in hue sails<br />
  His charges through the serpent's snare<br />
  <br />
  And the Lord of runes, so bored so soon,<br />
  Leaves the ship for an evening's dare,<br />
  Perchance to wake, the coiled snake,<br />
  To take its shirt of scales to wear<br />
  <br />
  And the Lady East, who e'ery beast,<br />
  Asleep or a'prowl can rouse a scare,<br />
  Screams as her eye, alight in the sky<br />
  A worm no goodly sight can bear<br />
  <br />
  And the mailed Steed, ajoins the deed<br />
  Not to be undone from his worthy share,<br />
  Rides the night, towards scale bright,<br />
  Leaving the seasoned Warrior's care<br />
  <br />
  Then the serpent rose, and made stead to close,<br />
  The targets lay plain and there,<br />
  But the Warrior's blade the Snake unmade,<br />
  And the charges wander no more, they swear</p>
