  <p class="sgc-1">by Annanar Orme</p>

  <p class="sgc-1"><br /></p>

  <p class="sgc-2">I.<br />
  I sing of Ellabeth, the Queen of the Axe,<br />
  Who could fell a full elm with two hatchet hacks.<br />
  She could rip apart Valenwood just for her fun.<br />
  She studied under Alfhedil in Tel Aruhn.<br />
  He taught her the jabs, the strokes, and the stance<br />
  To make an ax-swing into an elegant dance.<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  He taught her the barbed axes of the Orcs bold,<br />
  The six-foot-long axes favored in Winterhold,<br />
  The hollow-bladed axes of the Elves of the West,<br />
  Which whistle when they swing through flesh.<br />
  With a single-headed axe, she could behead two men.<br />
  With a double-headed axe, she could fell more than ten.<br />
  Yet where she lives in legend has most to do<br />
  With the man who hacked her own heart in two.<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  II.<br />
  Nienolas Ulwarth the Mighty, who hailed from Blackrose,<br />
  The only man who could best Ellabeth with ax blows,<br />
  In a minute, she chopped fifty trees; he, fifty-three.<br />
  She felt at once that he was the only man for she.<br />
  When she professed her love, Nienolas just laughed.<br />
  He said he loved more his ax handle and shaft.<br />
  And if they weren't enough to slake all his desire<br />
  There was another woman named Lorinthyrae.<br />
  Fury gripped the Queen of the Axe, the maid Ellabeth,<br />
  And her thoughts turned to pondering musings of death.<br />
  Mephala and Sheogorath gave her a revengeful scheme<br />
  And for weeks, she worked on it in a state like a dream.<br />
  In the still of the night, she kidnapped her rival<br />
  And then told her choices between doom and survival.<br />
  <br />
  III.<br />
  Lorinthyrae awoke in a house in the moors<br />
  In a room lightly furnished except for three doors.<br />
  Ellabeth explained that behind one of the doors the lass<br />
  Would find Ellabeth's and her love, the great Nienolas.<br />
  Behind the second lived a ravenous demon.<br />
  And behind the third, an exit to freedom.<br />
  She must choose a door, and to aid her decision<br />
  If she pondered too long, the axe'd make a division.<br />
  Lorinthyrae wept, and Ellabeth felt contrite,<br />
  And opened the door to her immediate right.<br />
  It led to the moors, and as she slipped through the gloom,<br />
  She advised Lorinthyrae to likewise abandon the room.<br />
  Lorinthyrae ignored her and did not feel her will bend.<br />
  Nienolas was largely behind the first door she opened.<br />
  <br />
  IV.<br />
  Ellabeth had lied; there was no demon of lore.<br />
  The top third of Nienolas was behind the third door.</p>
