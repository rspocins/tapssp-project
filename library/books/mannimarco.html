  <h2 class="sgc-1 sgc-3" id="heading_id_2">Mannimarco: King of Worms</h2>

  <p class="sgc-1">By Horicles<br /></p>

  <p class="sgc-1"><br /></p>

  <p class="sgc-2">O sacred isle Artaeum, where rosy light infuses air,<br />
  O'er towers and through flowers, gentle breezes flow,<br />
  Softly sloping green-kissed cliffs to crashing foam below,<br />
  Always springtide afternoon housed within its border,<br />
  This mystic, mist-protected home of the Psijic Order:<br />
  Those counselors of kings, cautious, wise, and fair.<br />
  <br />
  Ten score years and thirty since the mighty Remans fell,<br />
  Two brilliant students studied within the Psijics' fold.<br />
  One's heart was light and warm, the other dark and cold.<br />
  The madder latter, Mannimarco, whirled in a deathly dance,<br />
  His soul in bones and worms, the way of the necromance.<br />
  Entrapping and enslaving souls, he cast a wicked spell.<br />
  <br />
  The former, Galerion had magic bold and bright as day.<br />
  He confronted Mannimarco beneath gray Ceporah Tower,<br />
  Saying, 'Your wicked mysticism is no way to wield your power,<br />
  Bringing horror to the spirit world, your studies must cease.'<br />
  Mannimarco scoffed, hating well the ways of life and peace,<br />
  And returned to his dark artistry; his paints, death and decay.<br />
  <br />
  O sacred isle Artaeum, how slow to perceive the threat,<br />
  When the ghastly truth revealed, how weak the punishment.<br />
  The ghoulish Mannimarco from the isle of the wise was sent<br />
  To the mainland Dawn's Beauty, more death and souls to reap.<br />
  'You have found a wolf, and sent the beast to flocks of sheep,'<br />
  Galerion told his Masters, 'A terror on Tamriel has set.'<br />
  <br />
  'Speak no more of him,' the sage Cloaks of Gray did say.<br />
  'Twas not the first time Galerion thought his Masters callous,<br />
  Unconcerned for men and mer, aloof in their island palace.<br />
  'Twas not the first time Galerion thought 'twas time to build<br />
  A new Order to bring true magic to all, a mighty Mages Guild.<br />
  But 'twas the time he left, at last, fair Artaeum's azure bay.<br />
  <br />
  O, but sung we have of Vanus Galerion many times before,<br />
  How cast he off the Psijics' chains, bringing magic to the land.<br />
  Throughout the years, he saw the touch of Mannimarco's hand,<br />
  Through Tamriel's deserts, forests, towns, mountains, and seas.<br />
  The dark grip stretching out, growing like some dread disease<br />
  By his dark Necromancers, collecting cursed artifacts of yore.<br />
  <br />
  They brought to him these tools, mad wizards and witches,<br />
  And brought blood-tainted herbs and oils to his cave of sin,<br />
  Sweet Akaviri poison, dust from saints, sheafs of human skin,<br />
  Toadstools, roots, and much more cluttered his alchemical shelf,<br />
  Like a spider in his web, he sucked all their power into himself,<br />
  Mannimarco, Worm King, world's first of the undying liches.<br />
  <br />
  Corruption on corruption, 'til the rot sunk to his very core,<br />
  Though he kept the name Mannimarco, his body and his mind<br />
  Were but a living, moving corpse as he left humanity behind.<br />
  The blood in his veins became instead a poison acid stew.<br />
  His power and his life increased as his fell collection grew.<br />
  Mightiest were these artifacts, long cursed since days of yore.<br />
  <br />
  They say Galerion left the Guild, calling it 'a morass,'<br />
  But untruth is a powerful stream, polluting the river of time.<br />
  Galerion beheld Mannimarco's rise through powers sublime,<br />
  To his mages and Lamp Knights, 'Before my last breath,<br />
  Face I must the tyranny of worms, and kill at last, undeath.'<br />
  He led them north to cursed lands, to a mountain pass.<br />
  <br />
  O those who survived the battle say its like was never seen.<br />
  Armored with magicka, armed with ensorcelled sword and axe,<br />
  Galerion cried, echoing, 'Worm King, surrender your artifacts,<br />
  And their power to me, and you shall live as befits the dead.'<br />
  A hollow laugh answered, 'You die first,' Mannimarco said.<br />
  The mage army then clashed with the unholy force obscene.<br />
  <br />
  Imagine waves of fire and frost, and the mountain shivers,<br />
  Picture lightning arching forth, crackling in a dragon's sigh.<br />
  Like leaves, the battlemages fly to rain down from the sky,<br />
  At the Necromancers' call, corpses burst from earth to fight,<br />
  To be shattered into nothingness with a flood of holy light.<br />
  A maelstrom of energy unleashed, blood cascades in rivers.<br />
  <br />
  Like a thunderburst in blue skies or a lion's sudden roar,<br />
  Like sharp razors tearing over delicate embroidered lace,<br />
  So at a touch did Galerion shake the mountain to its base.<br />
  The deathly horde fell fatally, but heeding their dying cries<br />
  From the depths, the thing they called Worm King did rise.<br />
  Nirn itself did scream in the Mages' and Necromancers' war<br />
  <br />
  His eyes burning dark fire, he opened his toothless maw,<br />
  Vomiting darkness with each exhalation of his breath,<br />
  All sucking in the fetid air felt the icy touch of death.<br />
  In the skies above the mountain, darkness overcame pale,<br />
  Then Mannimarco Worm King felt his dismal powers fail:<br />
  The artifacts of death pulled from his putrid skeletal claw.<br />
  <br />
  A thousand good and evil perished then, history confirms.<br />
  Among, alas, Vanus Galerion, he who showed the way,<br />
  It seemed once that Mannimarco had truly died that day.<br />
  Scattered seemed the Necromancers, wicked, ghastly fools,<br />
  Back to the Mages Guild, victors kept the accursed tools,<br />
  Of him, living still in undeath, Mannimarco, King of Worms.<br />
  <br />
  Children, listen as the shadows cross your sleeping hutch,<br />
  And the village sleeps away, streets emptied of the crowds,<br />
  And the moons do balefully glare through the nightly clouds,<br />
  And the graveyard's people rest, we hope, in eternal sleep,<br />
  Listen and you'll hear the whispered tap of the footsteps creep,<br />
  Then pray you'll never feel the Worm King's awful touch.</p>
