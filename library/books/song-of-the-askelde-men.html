  <p class="sgc-1"><br /></p>

  <p class="sgc-2">Fifty Nights from home I last awoke<br />
  upon a sky-flung cliff in Hjaalmarch Hold<br />
  <br />
  Though my flesh had died and gone to ground<br />
  My Vision went on, from body unbound<br />
  <br />
  Winking there in the vale whence I came<br />
  This dead man's eyes saw pale flame<br />
  <br />
  Where men the same who took life away<br />
  Sung high their battle-glory and praise<br />
  <br />
  Wafting went I, a shade or a wight<br />
  Through stoic pines, pitched ink of night<br />
  <br />
  Ere I came upon the pyre-burning throng<br />
  I heard carried on wind's wing their song<br />
  <br />
  "Sing high and clear, bandsmen born of sky<br />
  Let Sovngarde hear and join our cry"<br />
  <br />
  "These honored dead shed blood upon the fen<br />
  Ending Orc and Elf and traitor men."<br />
  <br />
  "Your spirit went unto and filled their heart<br />
  You sped them to glory, Hail Spirit Wulfharth"<br />
  <br />
  Then oil from urns fed greedy flames<br />
  burning what few my legion and I slayed<br />
  <br />
  Wordlessy they chanted then until dawn<br />
  Every flake of ash gathered ere they marched on<br />
  <br />
  Swept along unseen, so too went I<br />
  Meekly haunting these Children of the Sky<br />
  <br />
  Tireless they went, over hearth and hill<br />
  Exhaustion seemed only to spur them still<br />
  <br />
  Unflagging they went, a whorl of rage<br />
  Soon finding our camp, bloated with prey<br />
  <br />
  My dead heart ached for I knew men within<br />
  Doomed, never knowing how close was their end<br />
  <br />
  Again the Nord chests swelled up in refrain<br />
  I screamed unheard. I wept with horror plain<br />
  <br />
  "Hear us, our ancestor, Ash King, Ysmir<br />
  Honor this warband as we to glory repair"<br />
  <br />
  "Those dead to whom you spoke and heard<br />
  We bear them upon us, Your valor conferred"<br />
  <br />
  And so it was, to the man each was smeared<br />
  With ash of a Brother's bone, blood and beard<br />
  <br />
  These ashen brutes, the Askelde Men<br />
  Set to a gruesome task, each bowstring bent<br />
  <br />
  I bellowed then, a cry of desperate rage<br />
  A futile howl among those men, an empty page<br />
  <br />
  Yet one elder turned and unblinking, stared<br />
  into the vapor-soul of me, his nostrils flared<br />
  <br />
  He bellowed ancient words, his beard aflame<br />
  And my vision fell away, Peace at last came</p>
