  <p><span class="sgc-5">Look upon the face of Boethiah and wonder. Raise your arms that Boethiah may look on them and bestow a blessing. Know that battle is a blessing. Know that death is an eventuality. Know that you are dust in the eyes of Boethiah.</span><br /></p>

  <p class="sgc-2"><br />
  Long is the arm of Boethiah, and swift is the blade.<br />
  <br />
  Deep is the cut, and subtle is the poison.<br />
  <br />
  Worship, o faithful. Pray your death is short.<br />
  <br />
  Worship, o faithful. Pray your death is quiet.<br />
  <br />
  Worship, o faithful. Worship the glory that is Boethiah.</p>
