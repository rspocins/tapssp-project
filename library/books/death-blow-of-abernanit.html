  <h2 class="sgc-1 sgc-3" id="heading_id_2">The Death Blow of Abernanit</h2>

  <p class="sgc-1">With Explains by the sage<br />
  Geocrates Varnus</p>

  <p class="sgc-1"><br /></p>

  <p class="sgc-2">Broken battlements and wrecked walls<br />
  Where worship of the Horror (1) once embraced.<br />
  The bites of fifty winters (2) frost and wind<br />
  Have cracked and pitted the unholy gates,<br />
  And brought down the cruel, obscene spire.<br />
  All is dust, all is nothing more than dust.<br />
  The blood has dried and screams have echoed out.<br />
  Framed by hills in the wildest, forlorn place<br />
  Of Morrowind<br />
  Sits the barren bones of Abernanit.<br />
  <br />
  When thrice-blessed Rangidil (3) first saw Abernanit,<br />
  It burnished silver bright with power and permanence.<br />
  A dreadful place with dreadful men to guard it<br />
  With fever glassed eyes and strength through the Horror.<br />
  Rangidil saw the foes' number was far greater<br />
  Than the few Ordinators and Buoyant Armigers he led,<br />
  Watching from the hills above, the field and castle of death<br />
  While it stood, it damned the souls of the people<br />
  Of Morrowind.<br />
  Accursed, iniquitous castle Abernanit.<br />
  <br />
  The alarum was sounded calling the holy warriors to battle<br />
  To answer villiany's shield with justice's spear,<br />
  To steel themselves to fight at the front and be brave.<br />
  Rangidil too grasped his shield and his thin ebon spear<br />
  And the clamor of battle began with a resounding crash<br />
  To shake the clouds down from the sky.<br />
  The shield wall was smashed and blood staunched<br />
  The ground of the field, a battle like no other<br />
  Of Morrowind<br />
  To destroy the evil of Abernanit.<br />
  <br />
  The maniacal horde were skilled at arms, for certes,<br />
  But the three holy fists of Mother, Lord, and Wizard (4) pushed<br />
  The monster's army back in charge after charge.<br />
  Rangidil saw from above, urging the army to defend,<br />
  Dagoth Thras (5) himself in his pernicious tower spire,<br />
  And knew that only when the heart of evil was caught<br />
  Would the land e'er be truly saved.<br />
  He pledge then by the Temple and the Holy Tribunal<br />
  Of Morrowind<br />
  To take the tower of Abernanit.<br />
  <br />
  In a violent push, the tower base was pierced,<br />
  But all efforts to fell the spire came to naught<br />
  As if all the strength of the Horror held that one tower.<br />
  The stairwell up was steep and so tight<br />
  That two warriors could not ascend it side by side.<br />
  So single-file the army clambered up and up<br />
  To take the tower room and end the reign<br />
  Of one of the cruellest petty tyrants in the annals<br />
  Of Morrowind,<br />
  Dagoth Thras of Abernanit.<br />
  <br />
  They awaited a victory cry from the first to scale the tower<br />
  But silence only returned, and then the blood,<br />
  First only a rivulet and then a scarlet course<br />
  Poured down the steep stairwell, with the cry from above,<br />
  "Dagoth Thras is besting our army one by one!"<br />
  Rangidil called his army back, every Ordinator and<br />
  Buoyant Armiger, and he himself ascended the stairs,<br />
  Passing the bloody remains of the best warriors<br />
  Of Morrowind<br />
  To the tower room of Abernanit.<br />
  <br />
  Like a raven of death on its aerie was Dagoth Thras<br />
  Holding bloody shield and bloody blade at the tower room door.<br />
  Every thrust of Rangidil's spear was blocked with ease;<br />
  Every slash of Rangidil's blade was deflected away;<br />
  Every blow of Rangidil's mace was met by the shield;<br />
  Every quick arrow shot could find no purchase<br />
  For the Monster's greatest power was in his dread blessing<br />
  That no weapon from no warrior found in all<br />
  Of Morrowind<br />
  Could pass the shield of Abernanit.<br />
  <br />
  As hour passed hour, Rangidil came to understand<br />
  How his greatest warriors met their end with Dagoth Thras.<br />
  For he could exhaust them by blocking their attacks<br />
  And then, thus weakened, they were simply cut down.<br />
  The villain was patient and skilled with the shield<br />
  And Rangidil felt even his own mighty arms growing numb<br />
  While Dagoth Thras anticipated and blocked each cut<br />
  And Rangidil feared that without the blessing of the Divine Three<br />
  Of Morrowind<br />
  He'd die in the tower of Abernanit.<br />
  <br />
  But he still poured down blows as he yelled,<br />
  "Foe! I am Rangidil, a prince of the True Temple,<br />
  And I've fought in many a battle, and many a warrior<br />
  Has tried to stop my blade and has failed.<br />
  Very few can anticipate which blow I'm planning,<br />
  And fewer, knowing that, know how to arrest the design,<br />
  Or have the the strength to absord all of my strikes.<br />
  There is no greater master of shield blocking in all<br />
  Of Morrowind<br />
  Than here in the castle Abernanit.<br />
  <br />
  My foe, dark lord Dagoth Thras, before you slay me,<br />
  I beg you, tell me how you know how to block."<br />
  Wickedly proud, Dagoth Thras heard Rangidil's plea,<br />
  And decided that before he gutted the Temple champion,<br />
  He would deign to give him some knowledge for the afterlife,<br />
  How his instinct and reflexes worked, and as he started<br />
  To explain, he realized that he did not how he did it,<br />
  And watched, puzzled, as Rangidil delivered what the tales<br />
  Of Morrowind<br />
  Called "The death blow of Abernanit."<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  Geocrates Varnus explains:<br />
  (1) "The Horror" refers to the daedra prince Mehrunes Dagon.<br />
  (2) "Fifty winters" suggests that the epic was written fifty years after the Siege of Abernanit, which took place in 3E 150.<br />
  (3) "Thrice-blessed Rangidil" is Rangidil Ketil, born 2E 803, died 3E 195. He was the commander of the Temple Ordinators, and "thrice-blessed" by being blessed by the Tribunal of Gods.<br />
  (4) "Mother, Lord, and Wizard" refers to the Tribunal of Almalexia, Vivec, and Sotha Sil.<br />
  (5) "Dagoth Thras" was a powerful daedra-worshipper of unknown origin who declared himself the heir of the Sixth House, though there is little evidence he descended from the vanished family.</p>
