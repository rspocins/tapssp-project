  <p class="sgc-1"><br /></p>

  <p class="sgc-2">Oh mighty tundrastrider!<br />
  <br />
  How you and your mighty tusked beast silhouette against the great orange expanse.<br />
  <br />
  Thundering footsteps herald your herd. Man and beast blazing trail together.<br />
  <br />
  One in nature, each relying upon the other, more than just man and beast, but equals who need one another to survive.<br />
  <br />
  How I long to run across the tundra in their mighty wake.<br />
  <br />
  That would truly be my greatest honor.<br />
  <br />
  The morning would be spent gathering dyes to paint our mammoths and then carve the fiercest images into their tusks.<br />
  <br />
  Then it would be time for the skeever hunt. Our clubs would rain down upon the rat pests smashing the life out of them.<br />
  <br />
  In the evening could sit around the campfire and I would regale those nearby with songs of their majesty and grace.<br />
  <br />
  They would let me sample of the mammoth's cheese. A food so foul yet with healing properties so great.<br />
  <br />
  We'd snack on the roasted skeever we'd freshly caught that day before laying under the stars to sleep.<br />
  <br />
  I'd slowly fade to dream nested in the radiating heat of mammoth fur. It's cold resisting properties keeping me snug.<br />
  <br />
  What a grand time we would have.<br /></p>
