  Lifts-Her-Tail<br />
  Certainly not, kind sir! I am here but to clean your chambers.<br />
  <br />
  Crantius Colto<br />
  Is that all you have come here for, little one? My chambers?<br />
  <br />
  Lifts-Her-Tail<br />
  I have no idea what it is you imply, master. I am but a poor Argonian maid.<br />
  <br />
  Crantius Colto<br />
  So you are, my dumpling. And a good one at that. Such strong legs and shapely tail.<br />
  <br />
  Lifts-Her-Tail<br />
  You embarrass me, sir!<br />
  <br />
  Crantius Colto<br />
  Fear not. You are safe here with me.<br />
  <br />
  Lifts-Her-Tail<br />
  I must finish my cleaning, sir. The mistress will have my head if I do not!<br />
  <br />
  Crantius Colto<br />
  Cleaning, eh? I have something for you. Here, polish my spear.<br />
  <br />
  Lifts-Her-Tail<br />
  But it is huge! It could take me all night!<br />
  <br />
  Crantius Colto<br />
  Plenty of time, my sweet. Plenty of time.<br />
