  <h2 class="sgc-1 sgc-3" id="heading_id_2">Song of Hrormir</h2>

  <p class="sgc-1"><br /></p>

  <p class="sgc-2">Hrormir<br />
  Son of Hrorgar<br />
  Summoned to the Court of Vjindak,<br />
  Son of Vjinmore, King of Evensnow.<br />
  "Mighty caster of magic,<br />
  I charge thee to go to Aelfendor,<br />
  For its hoary Warriors do threaten my Land<br />
  And bring forth their cousin Demons<br />
  To terrify my People."<br />
  Hrormir<br />
  Son of Hrorgar<br />
  Heard the Words of Vjindak Evensnow.<br />
  "By Icestaff,<br />
  Surely I would help thee<br />
  But I have already a Quest to drink<br />
  Twelve Flagons of Mead in one Hour,<br />
  And then to bed four Wenches,<br />
  Twice each.<br />
  So I must with grace decline."<br />
  The King he did not smile<br />
  At Hrormir and his jolly Spirit.<br />
  "By thine Honor<br />
  Must thou aidest my Cause<br />
  For must thou takest up the Sword<br />
  Of thy Companion Darfang<br />
  Who took the Quest and failed."<br />
  Hrormir laughed.<br />
  "Now I know thou jest.<br />
  My boon Mate Darfang wouldst not fail.<br />
  There be no finer Bladesman.<br />
  If thou chargest him, he wouldst not fall."<br />
  "I did not say he fell.<br />
  He joined the Dark Kings of Aelfendor<br />
  And by doing so dishonored<br />
  Himself and thee, his Friend."<br />
  <br />
  Hrormir could not believe the Words,<br />
  And yet, he knew Eversnow<br />
  Didst not lie.<br />
  So for twenty Days and three rodeth he<br />
  To the Land of Night, the Kingdom of Fear,<br />
  Where the Peasants ever carried Candles<br />
  Knowing what Evil awaiteth them<br />
  Should they stray beyond the Glow.<br />
  The Sovereigncy of three Dark Kings:<br />
  Aelfendor.<br />
  There, Torch in Hand, didst Hrormir<br />
  Pass through haunted Countryside<br />
  And frightened Villages,<br />
  And through the black Gates<br />
  Of the blacker Castle of Aelfendor.<br />
  The three Dark Kings didst sneer<br />
  At the sight of mighty Hrormir<br />
  And summoned they their Champion<br />
  Darfang the Blade.<br />
  "My boon Companion!"<br />
  Hrormir called in the Hall of Night.<br />
  "I dare not trust my Eyes,<br />
  For then I wouldst believe<br />
  That thou hast joined with Evil,<br />
  And turned thy Way from Honor<br />
  And Brotherhood!"<br />
  <br />
  "Hrormir!"<br />
  Darfang the Blade didst cry.<br />
  "If thou dost not go now,<br />
  One of us must die, for I hate thee!"<br />
  But Hrormir was battle ready,<br />
  And in the echoing Halls of Night<br />
  The Blade of Darfang<br />
  And the Staff of Hrormir<br />
  Didst strike again and yet again.<br />
  Mighty Warriors and Mages both,<br />
  The boon Companions now Foes,<br />
  Shook Mundus with their War.<br />
  They might have fought for a Year<br />
  If there were Sun in Aelfendor<br />
  To mark Time,<br />
  And either Hrormir or Darfang<br />
  May verily have won.<br />
  But Hrormir saweth through the Dark<br />
  The Tears in the Eyes of his former Friend,<br />
  And then he saweth the Shadow of Darfang<br />
  Wert not his own.<br />
  And so with Icestaff, he did strike<br />
  Not Darfang, but his Shadow, which cried.<br />
  "Hold, Mortal Man!"<br />
  <br />
  The Shadow becameth the Hag,<br />
  Bent and twisted, in her Cloak and Hood.<br />
  From her faceless Shadows, she hissed.<br />
  "Mortal Man called Hrormir<br />
  The Soul of thy boon Companion<br />
  Is my Plaything,<br />
  But I will take thine in trade,<br />
  For though ye both have strong Arms,<br />
  Thou hast the more clever Mind<br />
  Which my Sons the Dark Kings need<br />
  For a Champion of Aelfendor."<br />
  Hrormir the brave didst not take a Breath<br />
  Or pause before he boldly said.<br />
  "Shadowy Hag, release Darfang,<br />
  And thou mayst use me as thou will."<br />
  The Hag didst laugh and freed Darfang.<br />
  "To save thine Honor this thou hast done,<br />
  But now thou must be without Honor<br />
  Mortal Man, as the Champion<br />
  Of the Dark Kings, my Heirs of Gray Maybe,<br />
  Thou must help them divide Aelfendor,<br />
  And love me,<br />
  Thy Shadowy Hag and thy Mistress well."<br />
  <br />
  For his loss of Honor,<br />
  And his dear Friend's Sacrifice,<br />
  Noble Darfang prepared to take his Dagger<br />
  And plunge it in his good Heart,<br />
  But Hrormir stayed his Brother's Hand and whispered.<br />
  "No, boon Companion,<br />
  Wait for me at the Village Banquet Hall."<br />
  And then did Darfang the Blade leave the Castle<br />
  While Hrormir took the withered Claw<br />
  Of the Hag, and pressed it to his Lips.<br />
  "Shadowy Hag, to thee I pledge<br />
  To only honor thy black Words<br />
  To turn my back on Truth<br />
  To aid thy Dark Kings' Ambition<br />
  To divide their Inheritance fairly<br />
  To love thee<br />
  To think thee beautiful."<br />
  Then to the Chamber in the Heart of Night<br />
  Hrormir and the Hag did retire<br />
  Kissed he there her wrinkled Lips<br />
  And her wrinkled, sagging Breasts,<br />
  For ten Days and Nights and three did Hrormir<br />
  And his Icestaff<br />
  Battle thus.<br />
  <br />
  Then Sweet Kynareth blew honeyed Winds<br />
  O'er the Hills and Forest Glens of Aelfendor,<br />
  And the Caress of warm blooded Dibella<br />
  Coaxed the Blossoms to wanton Display<br />
  So that Aelfendor became a Garden<br />
  Of all the Senses.<br />
  The frightened Servants of the Dark Kings<br />
  Woke to find there was naught to fear<br />
  And through the once dark Streets of the Village<br />
  Came the Cries of Celebration.<br />
  In the Banquet Hall of the Village<br />
  Hrormir and his boon Companion Darfang<br />
  Embraced and drank of rich Mead.<br />
  The Shadowy Hag too was smiling,<br />
  Sleeping still in her soft Bed,<br />
  Until the morning Sun touched her naked Face<br />
  And she awoke, and saw All,<br />
  And knew All saw her.<br />
  And she cried out:<br />
  "Mortal Man!"<br />
  <br />
  Night fell fast upon the Land<br />
  As the Hag flew into the Banquet Hall<br />
  Casting blackest Darkness in her Wake<br />
  But all the Celebrants still could see<br />
  Her Anger<br />
  In her monstrous Face<br />
  And they shook with Fear.<br />
  The Hag had said the Kingdom was<br />
  To be divided among her Heirs.<br />
  But Aelfendor had been kept whole<br />
  While her Children divided,<br />
  Drawn and quartered.<br />
  Hrormir was mightily amused.<br />
  He swallowed his Laughter<br />
  In his Mead,<br />
  For none should laugh outright<br />
  At the Daedra Lord Nocturnal.<br />
  Without her gray Cowl of shadowed Night,<br />
  Her hideous Face forced the Moons<br />
  To hide themselves.<br />
  Hrormir the mighty did not quail.<br />
  "Wherest be thine Hood, shadowy hag?"<br />
  "Mortal Man hast taken it from me unaware.<br />
  When I awoke, my Face unmasked,<br />
  My Kingdom cast into the Light,<br />
  My Dark King Heirs in Pieces cast,<br />
  And here, my Champion smiles.<br />
  Yet in truth, thou kept thy Promise truly,<br />
  To never keep thy Promise true."<br />
  <br />
  Hrormir<br />
  Son of Hrorgar<br />
  Bowed to the Hag, his Queen.<br />
  "And evermore,<br />
  'Til thou releaseth me, will I serve thee so."<br />
  "A clever Mind in a Champion<br />
  Is a much overvalued Trait."<br />
  The Hag released Hrormir's Soul<br />
  And he released her Hood.<br />
  And so in the Light of darkest Dark,<br />
  She left Aelfendor evermore.<br />
  And after drinking twelve Flagons of Mead,<br />
  And bedding four Wenches<br />
  Twice each,<br />
  Did Darfang return to Eversnow<br />
  With Hrormir<br />
  Son of Hrorgar.</p>
