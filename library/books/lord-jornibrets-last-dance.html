  <h2 class="sgc-1 sgc-3" id="heading_id_2">Lord Jornibret's Last Dance</h2>

  <p class="sgc-1">(Traditional)<br /></p>

  <p class="sgc-1"><br /></p>

  <p class="sgc-2"><br />
  Women's Verse I:<br />
  Every winter season,<br />
  Except for the reason<br />
  Of one war or another<br />
  (Really quite a bother),<br />
  The Queen of Rimmen and her consort<br />
  Request their vassals come and cavort.<br />
  On each and every ball,<br />
  The first man at the Hall<br />
  Is Lord Ogin Jornibret of Gaer,<br />
  The Curse of all the Maidens Fair.<br />
  <br />
  Women's Refrain:<br />
  Oh, dear ladies, beware.<br />
  Dearest, dearest ladies, take care.<br />
  Though he's a very handsome man,<br />
  If you dare to take his handsome hand,<br />
  The nasty little spell will be cast<br />
  And your first dance with him will be the last.<br />
  <br />
  Men's Verse I:<br />
  At this social event<br />
  Everyone who went<br />
  Knew the bows and stances<br />
  And steps to all the dances.<br />
  The Queen of Rimmen and her consort<br />
  Would order a trumpet's wild report,<br />
  And there could be no indecision<br />
  As the revelers took position.<br />
  The first dance only ladies, separate<br />
  Away from such men as Lord Jornibret.<br />
  <br />
  Men's Refrain:<br />
  Oh, dear fellows, explain.<br />
  Brothers, can you help make it plain:<br />
  The man's been doing this for years,<br />
  Leaving maidens fair in tears<br />
  Before the final tune's been blast.<br />
  And her first dance with him will be the last.<br />
  <br />
  Women's Verse II:<br />
  Lord Ogin Jornibret of Gaer<br />
  Watched the ladies dance on air<br />
  The loveliest in the realm.<br />
  A fellow in a ursine-hide helm<br />
  Said, "The Queen of Rimmen and her consort<br />
  Have put together quite a sport.<br />
  Which lady fair do you prefer?"<br />
  Lord Jornibret pointed, "Her.<br />
  See that bosom bob and weave.<br />
  Well-suited for me to love and leave."<br />
  <br />
  Women's Refrain.<br />
  <br />
  Men's Verse II:<br />
  The man in the mask of a bear<br />
  Had left the Lord of Gaer<br />
  Before the ladies' dance was ending.<br />
  Then a trumpet sounded, portending<br />
  That the Queen of Rimmen and her consort<br />
  Called for the men to come to court.<br />
  Disdainful, passing over all the rest,<br />
  Ogin approached she of bobbing breast.<br />
  She was rejected, saved a life of woe,<br />
  For a new maiden as fair as snow.<br />
  <br />
  Men's Refrain.<br />
  <br />
  Women's Verse III:<br />
  At the first note of the band,<br />
  The beauty took Ogin's hand.<br />
  She complimented his stately carriage<br />
  Dancing to the tune about the marriage<br />
  Of the Queen of Rimmen and her consort.<br />
  It is very difficult indeed to comport<br />
  With grace, neither falling nor flailing,<br />
  Wearing ornate hide and leather mailing,<br />
  Dancing light as the sweetest of dreams<br />
  Without a single squeak of the seams.<br />
  <br />
  Women's Refrain.<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  Men's Verse III:<br />
  The rhythms rose and fell<br />
  No one dancing could excel<br />
  With masculine grace and syncopation,<br />
  Lord Jornibret even drew admiration<br />
  From the Queen of Rimmen and her consort.<br />
  Like a beauteous vessel pulling into port,<br />
  He silently slid, belying the leather's weight.<br />
  She whispered girlishly, "The hour is late,<br />
  But I've never seen such grace in hide armor."<br />
  It 'twas a pity he knew he had to harm her.<br />
  <br />
  Men's Refrain<br />
  <br />
  Women's Verse IV<br />
  The tune beat was furious<br />
  He began to be curious<br />
  Where had the maiden been sequest'ed.<br />
  "Before this dance was requested<br />
  By the consort and his Queen of Rimmen<br />
  I didn't see you dance with the women."<br />
  "My dress was torn as I came to the dance,"<br />
  She said smiling in a voice deep as a man's,<br />
  "My maids worked quickly to repair,<br />
  While I wore a suit of hide, a helm of a bear."<br />
  <br />
  Women's Refrain.</p>
