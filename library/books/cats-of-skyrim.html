  <p class="sgc-1">A Report By Aldetuile<br /></p>

  <p><br /></p>

  <p class="sgc-2">I have been sent to this frigid wasteland to catalogue and study any of its indigenous cats, which has so far been uneventful. After months of wandering I have so far only encountered some variations of the same basic species.<br />
  <br />
  In my travels I have encountered several khajiit outcast from their clans that have taken up residence in Skyrim. They have been most unhelpful, probably for fear I'd expose their locations. I can't say I'm surprised that there are few khajiit here, it's cold and unwelcoming.<br />
  <br />
  Sabrecats are basic giant cats that have evolved two dangerously sharp front teeth.<br />
  <br />
  The average sabrecat has a reddish brown fur which it uses to blend into grassy regions, but I have observed them skulking and sleeping on rocks so I don't believe the fur is for camouflage.<br />
  <br />
  The primary attacks of the sabrecat are its biting attack, but it can also briefly rear up to attack with its front claws. I have also seen it pounce forward on its prey in a particularly powerful attack.<br />
  <br />
  The snowy version of the sabrecat has spotted white fur which I believe it uses more for stalking more than its cousin in the plains.<br />
  <br />
  The tooth of the cat is rumored to be useful in potions that restore the imbibers stamina as well as a potion that will temporarily give a more keen eye for smithing.<br />
  <br />
  An skillful hunter can usually salvage the pelts and teeth of their kill, but report that the meat is tasteless and not fit to eat.</p>
